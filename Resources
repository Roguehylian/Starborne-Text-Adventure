DIAlOGUE for game


Main game:
The commander sent us out to explore the planet of darkness, code named "Nyxis", named after the goddess of night, Nyx. We trained for years, preparing for this one mission. Me, alongside my fellow colonizers, blasted into the starry galaxy in hopes of finding a Shadow Crystal. These crystals are said to be husks of former absolute might, a capsule that once held incredible power. gazing in awe at the ominous planet. Its purple haze pulsed, emitting a low, dull hum. All of a sudden, we lost total control of the ship. Its ominous sound only grew louder the closer we got to the planet. Clouds of violet fogged our vision as we dived straight towards the planet, until all we could see was darkness. I opened my eyes, only to find my entire team dead from the crash.. My body ached with pain, but.. I saw no injuries on myself. Still dazed, I walked towards the murky cave with my flashlight, confusion and fear stirring within me.
